# About renv:

renv is an R package that helps to make R projects more isolated, portable, and reproducible. It does this by creating an isolated, project-specific library for R packages, and by tracking the exact versions of packages that your project uses.

## Why We Use renv:

In this repository, we use renv to ensure that anyone who clones the project can easily recreate the exact R environment that was used to develop and run the code. This makes it easier to run the code on different machines and helps to avoid issues that can arise when different versions of packages have different behaviors or bugs.

## How renv Works:

When you clone this repository and open the R project for the first time, renv will recognize that it's in a project with a lockfile (renv.lock) and offer to restore the project library. If you agree, renv will install the packages and versions listed in the lockfile into the project-specific library.

When running the code, R will use the packages from this project-specific library rather than from your user- or system-wide library. This means that the versions of the packages used by the project are fixed and won't be affected by updates to packages in your personal library.
